# Bayesian Optimization Examples

## Main scripts:
 * ``BO_maximization.py``: Bayesian Optimization for function maximization 
 * ``BO_minimization.py``: Bayesian Optimization for function minimization 
 * ``GP_fit_noise.py``:  Gaussian Process fitting, noiseless function evaluations 
 * ``GP_fit_nonoise.py``: Gaussian Process fitting, noisy function evaluations

These examples are adapted from https://github.com/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning.git

 ## Slides
 Slides illustrating Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian Processes using the figures generated by the scripts above are in the folder ``slides``
